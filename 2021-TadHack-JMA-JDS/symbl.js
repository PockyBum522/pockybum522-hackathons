I love all the plants.  I just need to discuss with my family in terms of which one will we go forward with it?  It very excited to hear from you and the discount and look forward to talking sharply.  I have a quick question though.  Is there basically website?  Where I can go to and look at all these details myself.  It will be very helpful.  Can you also share the quotation to me on email so that I can go ahead and talk about it with my other kind of folks in the family? Thanks a lot.  Thanks for calling good catching up.  Talk soon.",
